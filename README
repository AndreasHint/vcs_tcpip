As part of the project, a bulletin board/billboard for messages of all kinds, will be realized. For the exercise, the Linux server annuminas.technikum-wien.at is used.

The project includes following files:
	simple_message_client.c
	simple_message_server.c
	Makefile
	README

simple_message_client.c
=======================
The function of the client is to establish a connection to the server. The message is sent to the server, then the write connection is closed and the client waits for a response, files received are stored in the file system. Connection to the server will be closed.

Usage: ./simple_message_client option
options:
	-s, --server <server> (full qualified domain name or IP address of the server)
	-p, --port <port> (well-known port of the server [0..65535])
	-u, --user <name> (name of the posting user)
	-i, --image <URL> (URL pointing to an image of the posting user)
	-m, --message <message> (message to be added to the bulletin board)
	-v, --verbose (verbose output)
	-h, --help (Display usage of the program)

simple_message_server.c
=======================
The function of the server is to wait for incoming connections from a client on a given port. For each accepted connection, a child process is created and the default server logic (simple_message_server_logic) is executed.

Usage: ./simple_message_server option
options:
        -p, --port <port> (well-known port of the server [0..65535])
        -h, --help (Display usage of the program)
